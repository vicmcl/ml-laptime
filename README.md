# ML-Laptime

## Description

This repository contains a machine learning model that predicts lap times for Formula One races using XGBoost. The model leverages historical race data, track information, weather conditions, and telemetry to provide accurate lap time estimations.

## Features

- Utilizes XGBoost, a powerful gradient boosting algorithm
- Incorporates multiple data sources for comprehensive predictions:
  - Previous race performance
  - Track-specific data
  - Real-time weather information
  - Car telemetry data
- Handles complex interactions between variables
- Provides feature importance analysis

## Data Sources

The model uses the following data sources:

1. Historical race results and lap times
2. Track characteristics (length, number of corners, altitude, etc.)
3. Weather data (temperature, humidity, wind speed, precipitation)
4. Car telemetry (speed, throttle, brake, gear changes, etc.)

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- XGBoost
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
